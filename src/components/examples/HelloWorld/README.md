This component was created to illustrate **how to**:

- Write ReactJS components in Typescript
- Use React State to store the data
- Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to create integration tests
- Use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to create a Story
- Render text from `.md` document inside the component

You can safely delete this component from the project and refer to it in the original [boilerplate](https://github.com/trucknet-io/trucknet-boilerplate-typescript-react).
